Django Appointments App built from scratch in 4.5 hours. Initially received a score of 8.6/10.0. Revised project after receiving grade to address all deductions and learn from mistakes.

Project contains complete log in and registration app connecting to sqlite.

Appointments & Login app has full validations on all form fields ie. password, birthday, name, email, appointment dates, conflicting appointment times, etc.

Users' passwords encypted using bcrypt.

Connected to backend database using django sqlite for all Appointment and User data. Saves appointments per user independent of sessions.

Used Twitter Bootstrap for basic styling on both login page and main appointments page.
