## Synopsis
This is a complete CRUD app built using Django that allows a user to log in/register and proceed to display, add, edit and/or delete day-to-day appointments. The aim of this app gives the user a dashboard to keep track of their appointments.

## Motivation
This app was built exam-style, from-scratch, timed in 4.5 hours in order to test proficiency of Python using the Django framework. Initially received a score of 8.6/10.0. I revised the project after receiving my grade to address all deductions, include any missing features, and learn from my mistakes.

## Features
- Appointments & Login app has full validations on all form fields ie. password, birthday, name, email, appointment dates, conflicting appointment times, etc.

- Users' passwords encypted using bcrypt.

- Connected to backend database using django SQLite for all Appointment and User data. Saves appointments per user independent of sessions.

- Used Twitter Bootstrap for basic styling on both login page and main appointments page.
